  ## Installation
  Install node, npm, and the packages "inquirer" and "jest". Once node is installed, in the terminal type "npm i" to install npm without any specific package dependencies. Then type "npm i inquirer" to install specific inquirer package. Do the same for the jest package as well.

  ## Usage
  Run the index.js file from the terminal using node. Type "node index.js" into the terminal and see automated questions appear. Type answers or choose answers, and view your team displayed on a generated index.html page in the "dist" directory.

  ## Tests
  Ensure the "jest" package is installed. Navigate to the "test" directory. Run tests for all js files by entering "npm run test" in the console.
